        <p>A FEW YEARS AFTER Summerglade we were
            sitting in Tommy's yard. Sean's sister Connie was tearing aluminum foil from cigarette
            packs to make small wedding rings to put on
            Chris's fingers, and I tried to hear what Tommy
            was saying to Amanda, and then Chris wanted
            to go to the limestone quarry in Neptune
            for a swim; when we squeezed into the car I
            ended up in Amanda's lap, and next to her was
            Tommy, who immediately put his arm around
            her and started rubbing her shoulder. I couldn't
            decide whether she liked his groping because
            she didn't resist him, and when we went up
            onto the highway he started playing with her
            hair and I turned away to look out the window,
            but Amanda must have noticed because she
            immediately put her hand on my thigh in be-
            tween my thigh and the car door where no one
            could see and ran her thumb up and down the
            fabric of my jeans, and everything was warm
            and I held my breath and didn't hear what
            anyone was saying until we got out of the car
            down in the quarry.</p>
